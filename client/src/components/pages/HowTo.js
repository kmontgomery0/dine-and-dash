      <p>Agent 69620,</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to the high-stakes world of international food heists. Your mission, should you
        choose to accept it, involves a daring journey across the globe, testing your knowledge and
        strategy under pressure.
      </p>
      <h3>Choose Your Heist's Difficulty</h3>
      <p>
        Select your challenge level - Easy, Medium, or Hard. Remember, the greater the risk, the
        greater the reward.
      </p>
      <h3>Initiate the Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Press 'Go' to start the clock. Time is of the essence, Agent. Once the mission starts,
        there's no turning back.
      </p>
      <h3>Your Starting Point</h3>
      <p>
        A world map will appear as your mission begins. Your starting country is randomly assigned.
      </p>
      <h3>Your Ultimate Goal</h3>
      <p>You will be assigned a target country. Navigate the globe to reach this destination.</p>
      <h3>Move Strategically</h3>
      <p>Click on adjacent countries to create your path. Plan wisely.</p>
      <h3>Face the Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Each new country presents a trivia question. Answer correctly to stay, or a wrong answer
        sends you back.
      </p>
      <h3>Target Assigned</h3>
      <p>
        Navigate through countries and overcome challenges to reach your goal country. The clock is
        ticking, so be swift and smart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, Agent, discretion is paramount. Trust your instincts, and your knowledge. The fate
        of the Trash Pandas rests in your hands.
      </p>
      <h3>Good luck.</h3>
